        <h1> OUR PHILOSOPHY</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>Participants, Speakers, Staff, </h2>
            <h2>Sponsors, Partners <b>together</b></h2>
            
            <p>
                Most event organizers are faced with the need to work with loads of different technologies for the
                management of people and entities who participate in their events. 
            </p>
            <p>
                cBooking gathers them all in a single plataform, providing the organizer with tools to register, track 
                and manage whoever is going to participate in their event.
            </p>

            <h2>A transparent and free tool </h2>
            <h2>Sponsors, Partners <b>together</b> </h2>
            <p>
                At cBooking we work to deliver a free tool that can promote the organization of events, by 
                supporting its logistics and registrations processes.
            </p>
            <p>               
                Whoever is participating in an event can register himself and reach other available events.
                To make it as smooth as possible for you, dear organizer: we process your data, track registrations, 
                and provide you with a private dashboard for the management of the event.
