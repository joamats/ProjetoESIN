    <h1> OUR PHILOSOPHY</h1>

        <h2>Participants, Speakers, Staff, </h2>
        <h2>Sponsors, Partners <b>together</b></h2>

        <p>
            Most event organizers are faced with the need to work with loads of different technologies for the
            management of people and entities who participate in their events.
        </p>
        <p>
            cBooking gathers them all in a single plataform, providing the organizer with tools to register, track
            and manage whoever is going to participate in their event.
        </p>

        <h2>A <b>free</b> and <b>transparent</b> tool </h2>
        <h2> to support event organizers </h2>
        <p>
            At cBooking we work to deliver a free tool that can promote the organization of events, by
            supporting its logistics and registrations processes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whoever is participating in an event can register himself and reach other available events.
            To make it as smooth as possible for you, dear organizer: we process your data, track registrations,
            and provide you with a private dashboard for the management of the event.
